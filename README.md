# Predicting_March_Madness_with_ML
As a team of 4, I collaborated to build a March Madness Bracket using Machine learning. Using 6 years of NCAA tournament data, PCA to reduce the dimensionality and K-Means clustering to group teams based on their performance, we trained five models to forecast the outcome of each round. Our best model was the Neural Network which achieved a F1 score of 76% and 75% accuracy score. We designed the tool to assist betting platforms anticipate matchups and identify potential upset games.
